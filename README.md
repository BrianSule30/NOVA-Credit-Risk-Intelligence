NOVA Credit Risk Intelligence: Enhancing Lending Strategy Through Data

Focus: Credit Risk Segmentation & Lending Optimization 

Tools Used: Power BI

Objective

Transform raw credit data into actionable intelligence to guide lending decisions, reduce default risk, and optimize borrower segmentation across demographics, geography, and loan intent.

Approach

Aggregated and cleaned loan data across 32K+ applicants

Segmented borrowers by loan grade, intent, employment status, and home ownership

Modeled delinquency and default patterns using historical behavior and demographic overlays

Built interactive dashboards to visualize risk exposure, income-to-loan ratios, and geographic performance

Enabled drill-through analysis by loan grade, borrower profile, and default history

Integrated dynamic filters for loan purpose, country, and credit history length

Key Insights

Total Loan Exposure: $312.43M across 32K+ borrowers

Default Risk: 156K flagged with prior defaults; education and medical loans showed highest delinquency rates

Income vs. Loan Ratio: Significant variance across employment types and home ownership status

Geographic Risk: UK, Canada, and USA showed similar delinquency volumes (~5.5K each)

Loan Grade Trends: Grade A–C carried higher delinquency counts; Grade D–F showed stricter approvals and lower exposure

Strategic Recommendations

Refine Risk Models: Incorporate loan intent and credit history length into scoring algorithms

Targeted Lending: Limit exposure to high-risk loan intents or require additional documentation

Dynamic Monitoring: Use predictive analytics to flag short credit histories and prior defaults

Geo-Based Adjustments: Monitor regional economic indicators to anticipate shifts in delinquency rates

Executive Insight

This project showcases how full-cycle analytics can transform credit risk management. By integrating borrower behavior, loan intent, and demographic segmentation, the dashboards empower financial institutions to make smarter lending decisions, reduce default exposure, and scale responsibly
